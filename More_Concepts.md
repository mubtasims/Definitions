Software Architecture: Architecture serves as a blueprint for a system. It provides an abstraction to manage the system complexity and establish a communication and coordination mechanism among components. It defines a structured solution to meet all the technical and operational requirements, while optimizing the common quality attributes like performance and security. Further, it involves a set of significant decisions about the organization related to software development and each of these decisions can have a considerable impact on quality, maintainability, performance, and the overall success of the final product. These decisions comprise of −
Selection of structural elements and their interfaces by which the system is composed.
Behavior as specified in collaborations among those elements.
Composition of these structural and behavioral elements into large subsystem.
Architectural decisions align with business objectives.
Architectural styles guide the organization.

Client/Server: Client/server architecture is a computing model in which multiple components work in strictly defined roles to communicate. The server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This type of shared resources architecture has one or more client computers connected to a central server over a network or internet connection.
Client/server architecture is also known as a networking computing model or client/server network because all the requests and services are delivered over a network. It’s considered a form of distributed computing system because the components are doing their work independently of one another.
In a client/server architecture, the server acts as the producer and the client acts as a consumer. The server houses and provides high-end, computing-intensive services to the client on demand. These services can include application access, storage, file sharing, printer access and/or direct access to the server’s raw computing power.
Client/server architecture works when the client computer sends a resource or process request to the server over the network connection, which is then processed and delivered to the client. A server computer can manage several clients simultaneously, whereas one client can be connected to several servers at a time, each providing a different set of services.
The client/server model as it evolved served pretty well for what some refer to as web 2.0, where the Internet slowly became a functional virtual space for users. It provided an established and predictable model for how user sessions would go, and how providers delivered resources based on requests for data packets and other resources.

Peer-to-Peer: Peer-to-peer architecture (P2P architecture) is a commonly used computer networking architecture in which each workstation, or node, has the same capabilities and responsibilities. It is often compared and contrasted to the classic client/server architecture, in which some computers are dedicated to serving others.
P2P may also be used to refer to a single software program designed so that each instance of the program may act as both client and server, with the same responsibilities and status.
P2P networks have many applications, but the most common is for content distribution. This includes software publication and distribution, content delivery networks, streaming media and peercasting for multicasting streams, which facilitates on-demand content delivery. Other applications involve science, networking, search and communication networks. Even the U.S. Department of Defense has started researching applications for P2P networks for modern network warfare strategies.
P2P architecture is often referred to as a peer-to-peer network.

Monolithic: A monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for the design of a software program. Monolithic, in this context, means composed all in one piece. According to the Cambridge dictionary, the adjective monolithic also means both too large and unable to be changed.
Monolithic software is designed to be self-contained; components of the program are interconnected and interdependent rather than loosely coupled as is the case with modular software programs. In a tightly-coupled architecture, each component and its associated components must be present in order for code to be executed or compiled.
Furthermore, if any program component must be updated, the whole application has to be rewritten, whereas in a modular application, any separate module (such as a microservice) can be changed without affecting other parts of the program. Modular architectures reduce the risk that a change made within one element will create unanticipated changes within other elements, because modules are relatively independent. Modular programs also lend themselves to iterative processes more readily than monolithic programs.

Microservices: Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:
Highly maintainable and testable
Loosely coupled
Independently deployable
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

REST: Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of Web services, such as SOAP Web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.
